	  <h1>Diet</h1>
	  <p>Cats are carnivores, and are generally fed a combination of wet and/or dry food. Cats diets change over time, with kittens needing very nutrient-dense food, and older cats may need special diets. Overall, cats' diets can be very individual, and consulting trusted sources, such as veterinarians, is important to keep your cat healthy.</p>

	  <tr>
	    <th>Food</th>
	    <th>Pros and Cons</th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Dry food</td>
	    <td>Dry food is convenient. It's easy to store and clean up, and it can sit out without spoiling. However, it does not provide moisture, and may have larger amounts of carbohydrates compared to protein.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Wet food</td>
	    <td>Many cats are prone to dehydration, and wet food helps to supplement this problem. Wet foods smell stronger, which makes them more appealing to older cats, whose senses of smell eventually grow weaker. However, it spoils quickly after being opened, and is generally more expensive than dry food.</td>
	  </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Raw meat</td>
            <td>When giving your cat a diet of raw meat, you choose exactly what it can eat. However, most people are not veterinarians, and it is better to consult one about what diet is best for a cat. Raw meat can be infected with bacteria or parasites. <a href="https://www.dvm360.com/view/pros-and-cons-raw-food-diets-proceedings">Commercial food is closely monitored by the FDA, but raw diets may not be regulated</a>. Many raw diets have not been very well tested, and may not be nutritionally sufficient for pets.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Cooked meat</td>
            <td>Some pets have special dietary needs which cannot be accommodated by commercial pet foods, and for some, homemade diets are the best option. Research and consulting reliable sources is necessary for homemade diets, to ensure a pet is well nourished and healthy. Home cooked food isn't always healthier than commercial meals.</td>
          </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Fish</td>
	    <td>Cats should not be fed an entirely fish diet. While fish provides a good source of protein, a cat should not survive entirely on fish. Cats fed entirely fish may experience thiamine deficiency, and <a href="https://www.cathealth.com/cat-care/nutrition/2246-ethoxyquin-mercury-and-pcbs-is-feeding-fish-safe-for-cats">certain types of fish have high levels of mercury</a>.</td>

	  <p>Every diet has its pros and cons, and individual cats have a tendency to be picky. Cats may not be willing to switch diets immediately, if you wish to switch to a different type of food.</p>
	  <p>Although cats should never be given entirely vegetarian diets, some foods are safe for cats to eat, such as cantaloupe or broccoli. Always look up whether or not something is safe for your cat before letting it try it.</p>

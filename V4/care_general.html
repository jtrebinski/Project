            <h1>General Care</h1>
	    <p>Certain basic information should be known when taking care of cats. This page will provide a short summary of some requirements.</p>
	  </section>
          <section id="leftColumn">
            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Grooming:</b> Cats are self cleaning, and rarely require baths. Some cats, such as long-haired cats, may require brushing to prevent matts.</li>
              <li><b>Scratching:</b> Cats need scratching posts or pads. Without them, cats will usually destroy furniture instead. To note, declawing is <em>never</em> an alternative. Declawing is equivalent to amputating the first knuckle in your hand, except if you walked with all your weight on your fingers. Declawing frequently leads to anxious behavior and pain, as it cuts off a major part of how cats interact with the world.</li>
              <li><b>Litter:</b> Litter boxes should be cleaned frequently, both to prevent disease, and to prevent your cat from learning to urinate elsewhere.</li>
	      <li><b>Socialization:</b> Cats are social creatures, and lonely cats become stressed. Signs of stress can include but are not limited to: frequent vocalization, obsessive grooming, and destructiveness. Providing attention and a stimulating environment can help to remedy this, or even adopting another cat. <a href="https://americanhumane.org/fact-sheet/introducing-cats-to-cats/">American Humane provides an excellent guide on adopting and introducing new cats.</a></li> 
              <li><b>Scruffing:</b> You've almost certainly seen images of mother cats carrying their kittens by the back of their neck. However, adult cats should not be scruffed! Lifting an adult cat by the scruff does not simulate being held by its mother, it is just uncomfortable and frightening.</li>
	      <li><b>Spaying/Neutering:</b> You may have heard people claim that spaying and neutering is cruel to animals. <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/spayneuter-your-pet#:~:text=Spaying%20helps%20prevent%20uterine%20infections,cancer%20and%20some%20prostate%20problems.">This is not true</a>. Spaying and neutering provides behavioral and health benefits, and all cats should be spayed or neutered. As long as cared for properly and not fixed early than your vet recommends, spaying and neutering is beneficial. Additionally, leaving your cat with the chance of getting pregnant or getting other cats pregnant contributes to overpopulation. Kittens are cute, but they cannot always be cared for. Fixing a cat does far less harm than contributing to overpopulation and inevitable suffering.</li>

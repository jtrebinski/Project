	<h1>A Brief History on Cats</h1>
	<p>House cats are felines first domesticated around ancient Egypt. Some evidence suggests that cats may have domesticated themselves, choosing to live with humans. As cats would feed on grain-eating rodents, humans and cats benefited from each other's presence.</p>
	<p>In modern times, most cats are household companions, although some remain as barn cats. Household cats are kept as companions, spending their days relatively safe from disease and danger in the care of humans.

	  <li><h2>Behavior</h2>
	  <p>Cats exhibit nocturnal and crepuscular activity, meaning that they are frequently active at dawn and dusk or night. They're carnivorous, requiring all meat diets. Cats are social creatures, and communicate through body language and certain noises, such as purring, hissing, and meowing.</p></li>
	  <li><h2>Characteristics</h2>
	  <p>Similar to dogs, cats have very good noses, and they rely on their sense of smell to evaluate whether or not food is safe to eat. The whiskers on their faces and legs are used to detect minute vibrations, which aids in hunting prey. Their tails aid them in balance, which is useful for climbing high places.</p></li>
